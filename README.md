Falk_Szech_MoralsAndMarkets_Science_2013
========================================

This repository is intended to serve as an easy access to the data in the [2013 "Science" paper of Falk and Szech, Morals and Markets](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6133/707.full.pdf).

Figures
-------------

![Figures](./Figures.md) can be found here.


Data source
-------------
The original data is pulled from the authors' website and the two included figures are displayed in a slightly different way.

Next steps
----------
Next steps would be to add the reported regressions, for which the so far unused data in tab_s1.dta is probably to be used.

Goal
----------
The goal of this work is to eventually make the analysis of the original authors even more accessible and foster a good discussion w.r.t. content and the appropriateness of the methods chosen.
